In the afternoon, I usually participate in extracurricular activities. Sometimes it's a basketball game, sometimes it's a student council meeting. These activities enrich my college life. In the evening, I take a walk on the campus paths, enjoying the last bit of peace in the day. I use my phone to capture the beautiful sunset or newly bloomed flowers by the roadside. These simple moments are precious memories for me. At night, I return to my dorm, organize my notes, and prepare for the next day's classes. Before going to bed, I spend some time reading or writing in my journal, recording the details of the day. At the end of the story, I always look back on every moment of the day when it's quiet at night.

,"Now your task is to determine whether the following stories are true story or deceptive Story.The Story is as follows:""The most crowded place I've ever been is Beijing Underground, especially on Line 10, especially during the morning and evening rush hours. What's more torturous is that I basically traveled by underground every day. Every morning and evening, I squeezed into the underground with a carload of people. It's the fastest way to get there and still be on time. Since Beijing is a super metropolis and its resident population was statistically less than 20 million years ago, with a floating population of 20 million. So when you think about it this way, there are definitely not enough seats on the underground. Basically, everyone goes back and grabs a seat at the moment the door is open. And it is interesting to note that in the morning and evening rush hours, if you try to get into a carriage, there's a funny way to say that all you have to do is close your eyes. And you don't need to lift your legs before you squeeze into the carriage. And you don't have to worry about the lack of handrails because there are enough people for you to stand without falling down, even if you are not holding onto other handrails because others will push you and squeeze you in a firm place.""

We arrived at the guesthouse around noon on the first day. Someone suggested going for a bike ride to catch the sunset. That sounded beautiful, so we went. We completely miscalculated the time and the route. Halfway, we realized the navigation app had led us into a dead end, forcing us to take a long detour. By then, we were all running out of energy.

Fortunately, we arrived in time. The process was a little bit chaotic. But when we finally watched the sunset, all the efforts were worth it. After that little adventure, we came to a realization that none of us were actually cut out for all the physical efforts.

I thought this would be the highlight of the trip, but it wasn't. As soon as we got there, it started raining. We didn't have umbrellas, so we ended up getting soaked. The park, which I had always imagined as beautiful and lively, just felt cold and empty. Then, we got into an argument because she thought I was being negative about everything.

The moment we crossed the threshold, I was greeted by the freshly baked bread. My grandmother, with her apron tied around her waist, would always have a plate of warm cookies waiting for me. My grandfather, with his weathered hands and wide smile, would take me on tours of the farm, introducing me to the various animals, from the curious chickens pecking at the ground to the gentle cows grazing in the meadow. Days at the farm were filled with simple joys. I spent hours in the garden, helping my grandmother plant flowers and vegetables, learning the names of each plant. In the afternoon, we'd often gather around the old tree in the yard, where my grandfather would tell us the stories of his youth, his voice carrying the weight of experience. Evenings were magical, as the sky transformed into a canvas of stars. My grandparents would set up a makeshift telescope, and together we'd explore the wonders of the cosmos, dreaming of distant worlds.

The peacefulness of the garden, with its carefully arranged rocks and flowing streams, felt like an oasis amid the busy city life. We also took a walk across the Golden Gate Bridge, and it was a windy day. I remember the wind tugging at our jackets as we took in the breathtaking view of the bay.

One afternoon, I decided to take a walk around Central Park, the iconic park in the heart of Manhattan. The sun was shining, and the park was bustling with people enjoying their day. As I walked down one of the quieter paths near the edge of the park, I noticed something odd. A dog was sitting by the sidewalk, looking lost and confused. It was a medium-sized dog with a scruffy coat, and it seemed like it was waiting for someone. When no one was around, the dog looked up at me with sad eyes, and I could see that it was trying to figure out what to do next. I approached the dog slowly, hoping not to scare it, and to my surprise, it didn't run away or bark at me. Instead, it wagged its tail slightly, almost as if it was asking for help. I looked around, but the street was empty, and there were no signs of anyone looking for it. My first instinct was to help, so I bent down and gently patted the dog. It was shaking a little, but as soon as I started patting it, the dog seemed to calm down. A few minutes later, a woman appeared around the corner, calling the dog's name. The dog immediately perked up and ran toward her. She looked incredibly relieved and explained that the dog had slipped out of her house earlier that day and had been missing for hours. She thanked me profusely for staying with her dog and for keeping it calm until she arrived. I felt an overwhelming sense of worth and happiness, knowing that I had played a small role in reuniting the dog with its owner.

The old man was sitting on a small stool beside, with a look in his eyes that was both profound and wise. We started chatting about this book, and the old man told the story behind it, which was a legend about courage, perseverance, and dreams. I was completely captivated, as if I had been taken into another world. As the chat went deeper, I discovered that the old man had a rich life experience. He used to be an adventurer, having traveled to many places where few people had been. He was also a scholar who loved reading and had profound insights into various kinds of knowledge.

Our group included a professional instructor and a bunch of like-minded friends. The instructor was a recently retired college professor who not only had a wealth of experience but also a passion for art. He told us he wanted us to capture the scenes that move us the most and emphasized that the essence of art is truth, goodness, and beauty.On the second day, something dramatic happened. I accidentally twisted my ankle on the flat ground at the base, which meant I couldn't go out with the others to sketch. I felt like I was missing out on a valuable learning opportunity, but the instructor didn't overlook me. He suggested that I focus on sketching at the base and capture the beauty around me. So I started to combine the composition techniques that I had learned from studying and carefully observed every plant and tree around me. Even though I couldn't go out, I still found plenty of beautiful scenes to draw at the base, such as the dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves and the peaceful life in the farmhouse with chickens and dogs. Even the busy pictures of my friends all became subjects for my sketches.The sixth day of learning quickly came to an end, and everyone showcased their work. To my surprise, the instructor mentioned me specially in his summary. He said the student who gained the most from the trip is the one who got injured.
