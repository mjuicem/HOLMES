Wuzhou-du, Jumonji Mountain join Union Headquarters. In the corner of the hideout, there's a small vault that looks ordinary at first glance. There's scattered documents and an electronic device on the table, a worn-out sofa, and a few float-closing shortage components, forming a simple rest area. However, the bookshelf in the corner is actually a mobile security door, when my senior opens it, it reveals a passage leading underground. Within the hideout lies what we've seen. This is more like a planning counter-corridor for garbage than a basement. In the center are three waste bowls. As I approach them, I see the map of a non-adjoined city divided into various closed zones, resembling a complex chessboard. So, this is your operation center. So, it's not only a contact point for the audience, but also our home. The computer and screen you see are tools we use to collect and harness information. Look, this barrage zone are under border house control, where they contact various illegal activities, including selling cybernetic enhancements and slugging weapons. The blue zone, on the other hand, are other areas of operation, where we strive to maintain order. I have never seen so many high-tech devices before. By the way, why is the brotherhood here too? What do you mean, why is it here too? The brotherhood's headquarters is right here. Heard that the prison security department recently crawled down a hole around there. Arresting many key members severely weakened them. But the leader of the brotherhood in the non-adjoined city is the cunning and sly chief-instructor Du Kang. And I have heard that the brotherhood's president has been in hiding for a long time. Perhaps this is a profane appearance and he aims to rise to power.
