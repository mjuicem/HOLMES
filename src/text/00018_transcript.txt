Last autumn, I visited Hangzhou with my friends. It was my first time there, and I was very excited. Hangzhou is famous for West Lake. So we went there on the first morning. The lake was very beautiful, with mountains in the distance and boats floating on the water. The air was fresh, and the view looked like a paint. We rented a small boat and enjoyed the peaceful scenery. The boatman told us stories about the lake, like the legend of the West Lake. It was interesting to hear. In the afternoon, we visited the Lingyin Temple. The temple was quiet and full of history. Tall trees surrounded the area, and the smell of incense filled the air. Inside, we saw many still and old carvings. It was a peaceful place where we could rest and sing. The trip to Hangzhou was relaxing and fun. I will always remember its natural beauty and delicious food.
