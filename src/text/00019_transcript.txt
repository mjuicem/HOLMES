In May this year, I visited Fragrant Hill with a friend. It's very hot in summer in Beijing, but luckily it was cloudy that day. The clouds took part of the heat of us, so we didn't feel very hot. Fragrant Hill was very beautiful. We chose a steep path and started our mountain climbing journey. Surrounded by many green plants, I felt sufficient oxygen, and my body seemed to be lighter. On the way up to the mountain, we chatted and enjoyed the scenery at the same time, feeling the happiness brought by aerobic exercise. When we reached at the top of the mountain, we found a place in the long pavilion and sat down to rest. Many little sparrows appeared in front of us. I was a little surprised. I didn't expect that there would be so many sparrows on such a high mountain. They didn't seem to be afraid of people either. One even landed beside me, shaking its little hand lightly. It was very cute. However, the way down to the mountain was not that easy. After walking for a while, I already felt my legs shaking. I couldn't help saying that I lacked exercise in my daily life. After going down to the mountain, we had a meal and then went back to the school. I felt that although climbing the mountain was a little tiring, it was very enjoyable.
