When I was in middle school, I joined a cultural exchange program that took me to the United States. It was my first time traveling abroad, and I was both nervous and excited. Our trip lasted two weeks, and during that time we visited several cities, universities, and famous landmarks. One of the most memorable experiences was visiting Harvard University. The campus was exactly like what I have seen in movies. Historic buildings surrounded by lush greenery. I remember standing in front of the ironic Wiener Library, taking photos, and imagining what it would be like to study here. During our guide tour, the student guides shared fascinating stories of life at Harvard, including the traditions and challenges students faced. Another unforgettable moment was when we visited Times Square in New York City. The bright lights, giant billboards, and the sheer energy of the place were overwhelming. However, one of the funnest incidents happened at a local dinner when I tried to order a turkey sandwich. I accidentally said chicken instead, and when my order arrived, I was too embarrassed to correct it, so I just ate it quickly. This trip was not only an opportunity to improve my English, but also a chance to learn about American culture. Meet new friends, and step out of my comfort zone. It left a deep impression on me and sparked my interest in studying abroad in the future.
