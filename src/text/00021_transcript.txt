I want to share a story about my daily life. I'm a college student, and well, my days are simple. They are filled with my dream and melody. My day begins with the alarm clocked in my dorm room. I quickly get up, fresh up, and rush to the library. I love to the library. It's where my day of learning starts. Sunlight streams through the windows and spills onto my desk. As I open my books and immerse myself in the ocean of knowledge. At noon, I meet up with friends in the cafeteria. We enjoy lunch together while sharing funny stories and learning experiences. These relaxed conversations are the source of joy in my day. In the afternoon, I usually participate in extreme circular activities. Sometimes it's a basketball game. Sometimes it's a student council meeting. These activities enrich my college life. In the evening, I take a walk on the campus paths, enjoying the last bit of peace in the day. I use my phone to capture the beautiful sunset or newly bloomed flowers by the roadside. These simple moments are precious memories for me. At night, I return to my dorm, organize my notes, and prepare for the next day's classes. Before going to bed, I spend some time reading or writing in my journal, recording the details of the day. At the end of the story, I always look back on my every moment of the day when it's quiet at night. So each day seems ordinary. I know that these melodies of daily life are weaving into the most beautiful symphony of my life.
