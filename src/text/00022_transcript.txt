The most crowded place I've ever been is Beijing underground, especially Linetown, especially during the morning and evening rush hours. What's more torturous is that I basically traveled by underground every day. Every morning and evening I squeezed into the underground with a carload of people. The metro is the fastest way to get here and still be on time. Since Beijing is a super metropolis and its resident population was statistically less than 20 million years ago, with a floating population of 20 million, so when you think about it this way, there are definitely not enough seats in the underground. Basically everyone goes back and grabs a seat at the moment the door opens. And it is interesting to note that in the morning and evening rush hours, if you try to get into a carriage, there's a funny way to say that all you have to do is close your eyes and you don't need to lift your legs before you squeeze into the carriage, and you don't have to worry about the lack of handrails, because there are enough people for you to stand without falling down, even if you are not holding to other handrails, because others will push you and squeeze you in a firm place.
