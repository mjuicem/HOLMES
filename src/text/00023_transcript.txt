Winter of 2022, it was Chinese New Year, and our family followed our hometown tradition to visit my grandma's house, which is also my mom's place. The day was bright and sunny. Dad, Mom, my brother and I drove over to grandma's. We exchanged New Year greetings with each other. After the greetings, Mom's sleepy son read envelopes to the little ones at grandma's and told them to study hard and work hard in a small voice. Meanwhile, my brother and I also got read envelopes. Then we sat in the courtyard, soaking in the sunshine and chatting with each other. Suddenly, someone suggested, hey, let's play some poker cards. I jumped up right away and said, yes, I want to play. So I quickly got the poker cards, and then we all dived into a game of poker. We were all having so much fun.
