Back in 2020, I went to visit my cousin in New York. I had been so excited about this trip because I hadn't seen her in years, and I'd never been to New York before. I spent weeks planning everything, from the places we'd visit to the restaurants we'd try. But from the moment I landed, things started to go wrong. First, my flight was delayed by almost six hours. I was stuck at the airport, feeling tired and annoyed, waiting with no clear idea of when I'd get to leave. When I finally arrived in New York, I discovered that my luggage had been lost. I had to spend over an hour at the airport, filling out forms and talking to airline staff, but nobody could tell me when my bag would be found. When I finally got to my cousin's apartment, I was already in a bad mood. I thought we'd had a nice dinner and catch up, but she told me she had to work late that evening, so I was left on my own in a strange city. I ordered some takeout, but it wasn't very good, and I spent the evening feeling lonely and frustrated. The next day, my cousin suggested we visit Central Park. I thought this would be the highlight of the trip, but it wasn't. As soon as we got there, it started raining. We didn't have umbrellas, so we ended up getting soaked. The park, which I had always imagined as beautiful and lively, just felt cold and empty. Then, we got into an argument because she thought I was being negative about everything. The tension between us ruined the rest of the day. By the time I flew back home, I was completely exhausted and disappointed. I had spent so much time and effort planning this trip, but nothing had gone the way I had hoped. I couldn't wait to leave and just forget about the whole thing.
