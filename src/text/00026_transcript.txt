When I was a young child, summer break meant one thing above all else, a trip to my grandparents' farmhouse in the countryside. The anticipation of this visit always filled me with excitement, as I knew it promised a break from the pressure of city life. The moment we crossed the threshold, I was greeted by the freshly baked bread. My grandmother, with her apron tied around her waist, would always have a plate of warm cookies waiting for me. My grandfather, with his weathered hands and wide smile, would take me on tours of the farm, introducing me to the various animals, from the curious chicken pecking at the ground to the gentle cows grazing in the meadow. Days at the farm were filled with simple joys. I spent hours in the garden, helping my grandmother plant flowers and vegetables, learning the names of each plant. In the afternoon, we'd often get around the old tree in the yard, where my grandfather would tell us the stories of his youth, his voice carrying the weight of experience. Evenings were magical, as the sky transformed into a canvas of stars. My grandparents would set up a makeshift telescope, and together we'd explore the wonders of the cosmos and dreaming of distant worlds. Those summer days at my grandparents' farmhouse were a time of pure happiness. They taught me the value of hard work, the beauty of nature, and the importance of family bonds. Even now, as an adult, those memories continue to inspire and nourish my soul.
