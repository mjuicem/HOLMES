In 2020, I went to Sydney to visit an old friend I hadn't seen in over 10 years. We had reconnected online during the pandemic and talked a lot about how much we missed hanging out in person. So, as soon as it was safe to travel, I booked a trip. When I arrived, my friend met me at the airport with a huge hug. It felt like no time had passed. We started the day with breakfast at a small cafe near her apartment. The food and coffee were great, and we couldn't stop laughing while sharing stories about our lives. After breakfast, we decided to take a ferry across Sydney harbour. The weather was perfect, and the view of the opera house was stunning. Seeing it in person was completely different from the pictures I had seen. My friend suggested we take a guided tour, and it was such a good idea. The guide shared lots of interesting facts, like how it took years to build and how its design was chosen in a global competition. We even got to hear a story happening in one of the halls. The sound of the orchestra was amazing. That evening, we were lucky enough to get tickets to a live show at the opera house. The mix of music and dance was incredible, and it was one of the best performances I'd ever seen. After the show, we walked along the harbour, enjoying the city lights and talking about old memories. It was a day full of happiness and unforgettable moments.
