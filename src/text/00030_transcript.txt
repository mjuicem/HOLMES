In 1920, I traveled to Chicago for a work meeting. It was my first time visiting the United States and I felt both excited and a bit scared. The flight was long, but I enjoyed looking out of the window and thinking about the adventure ahead. When I landed at O'Hare Airport, I took a taxi to my hotel. The tall buildings and the busy streets made me feel like I had stepped into a movie. On my second evening, I went for a walk along the Chicago River Walk. The lights from the tall buildings reflected on the water and it looked magical. As I was walking, I noticed a small Italian restaurant that didn't seem very busy. I felt curious, so I decided to go in and have dinner there. The food was delicious and the place felt very cozy. While I was eating, I saw an old man sitting alone at a table near the window. He was sketching something in a notebook. I couldn't help but ask him about it. He smiled warmly and invited me to join him. He told me he used to be a charity and had worked on some of Chicago's famous buildings. Like the Wells Tower, he showed me some of his sketches, which were amazing and shared stories about his life in the city. I ended up spending hours talking to him, learning about Chicago's history and its people. Meeting him made my trip so much more special. Although I didn't have time to explore everything in the city, the memories stayed with me. I hope I can return to Chicago one day to create more memories like this.
