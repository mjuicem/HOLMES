Last spring, I got the chance to visit Tokyo, Japan during the cherry blossom season. I had always wanted to see the cherry blossom, and it was even better than I imagined. I went to Tokyo during a short break between semesters, just in time for the blossoms to be as their best. When I stepped out of the train station, I saw cherry trees everywhere, on the streets, in the parks, and among the viewers. On the first day, I went to Philosopher's Pass. It is a stone path next to a small canal, and both sides are lined with cherry trees. The blossoms were in full bloom, and some of the petals were falling into the water, making it look pink. I walked slowly along the path, enjoying the view. There were many people there, some taking pictures, some just sitting under the trees, and even though it was crowded, it felt very peaceful. Everyone seemed happy just to be there, enjoying the flowers. In the evening, I went to another park. This had lit up the cherry trees, and it looked magical. The biggest trees in the park were full of pale pink flowers, and its lights made it seem like something out of a dream. Many people were there, some sitting on blankets, others walking slowly under the trees, and I walked under the glowing blossoms, feeling like I was in a different world.
