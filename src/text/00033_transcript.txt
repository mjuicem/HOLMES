Last year, I went on a trip to Singapore. I was excited to explore the city and its diverse scenes. My first stop was the famous center in Chinatown, where I tried a variety of local dishes. I had the best, both of which incredible, flavorful and satisfying. The environment was lively with people from all walks of life and enjoying their meals. I felt a sense of excitement and happiness, following the unique tastes and energy of the place. The next day, I went and visited another city, known for its flower domes. Walking through the gardens, I was amazed by the design and the variety of plants. I felt a deep hype for the beauty and innovation of the urban plants. Later, I met a local graduate who showed me around the neighborhoods of Singapore. He shared his stories about the city's past and its rapid development. I feel the mass of admiration learning about the rich cultural heritage and modern achievements. The trip to Singapore was a wonderful blend of designs and cultural exploration, and I left with many memories and hype on the world.
