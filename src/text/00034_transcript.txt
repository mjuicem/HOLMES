Last year, I planned a trip to Paris to attend the opening of a renowned art gallery showcasing the work of my favorite artist. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and I had been preparing for months. I had carefully saved up, purchased tickets well in advance, and planned every detail of the journey the gallery was scheduled to open on a Saturday evening, and my flight was set for Friday morning to ensure I had plenty of time. On the day of the flight, everything started to go wrong. I woke up later than planned because I had stayed up packing the night before. I rushed through my morning routine, keeping breakfast and hurriedly called a taxi to the airport. The driver tried to navigate the morning traffic, but it seemed every road was congested. I nervously checked my watch every few minutes, my heart sinking as the minutes ticked by. By the time we reached the airport, I had only 20 minutes left before takeoff. I sprinted to the check-in counter only to be told that the gate had closed and my flight had already begun boarding. I stood there in disbelief, watching the departure board as my flight status changed to departed. Disappointment was overwhelming. I had looked forward to this event for so long. Imagine myself walking through the gallery surrounded by the works of an artist who had inspired me deeply. Facing the flight felt like I had let the dream slip through my fingers. Emotions tied to such an experience makes me appreciate the importance of preparation and timing. It's a reminder to never take opportunities for granted.
