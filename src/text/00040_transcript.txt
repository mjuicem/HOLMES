Back in 2020, I went to visit my high school classmate, Ji Jiang. He was in Zhejiang University, so I went to Zhejiang Hangzhou to visit him. We planned to visit Red Lake together to see the beautiful landscape. But, because of an accident, the plan cancelled. My friend, Ji Jiang, made his leg hurt just yesterday before I went to Hangzhou. So, we finally went to see a movie. It was a very happy time with him because he was one of my best friends. So, no matter what we do, we still have a good time. After that, we went to a restaurant to taste some famous dishes in Hangzhou. I can still remember many dishes. For example, like Xi Hu Chu Yu and Rong Jin Xia Ren, Dong Po Rou, and so on. That was very delicious. Until today, I still can't forget the flavor. I enjoyed a very good time in Hangzhou. And I can't wait the next time I went to Hangzhou. Hope can experience more interesting things there again.
