I met my girlfriend when we signed up in the same group for the first time. She was pretty but silent. In order to talk about how to do our work later, we exchanged our WeChat IDs. After all the works were done, I asked her to come out and hang around one day. I was excited when I sent that message. Even she said yes, I still cannot believe that was real. Also, I was very nervous because that was my first time walk around with a girl. We went around the school for a long time and talked about a lot of things. From study to dreaming future and so on. At the end of the day, I was so glad to hear that she said she likes going around with me and expects the next time we come out and chat with each other. After our few times hang out, I bought flowers for her and gave her when she did not even know it. She was surprised and then I declared my love for her. I asked whether she would like to be my girlfriend and she said yes. And until now, we had been together for almost 650 days. Yes, that was a quite long time but I think the time we came together will be longer and longer. Thank you for watching!
