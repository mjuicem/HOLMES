I went to a live house several weeks ago for meeting my idol, Shi Yi, and that was the first time for her to start a live house in Beijing, so I cherished that opportunity and bought my ticket instantly. And when I finally arrived there, I saw a lot of fans just like me. They sent us many little gifts for free, and that was really, really happy for me. However, because there are too many people, so when I got into the house, my place is a little bit far from the stage. But it doesn't affect my passion of listening to the beautiful, amazing music. What is more fantastic is I was selected as the lucky one to go onto the stage and take a shot with my idol. I was really excited at that time, and I couldn't certainly describe the mood at that time. I was just so happy.
