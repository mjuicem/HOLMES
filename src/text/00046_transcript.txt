About one week ago, I took a trip to Hainan to see my best friend from high school. It's someone I hadn't seen for a really long time. Hainan is such a wonderful place. The sun is shining brightly, the beaches are long and sandy, and the wind feels so good. I fell in love with the big blue sea right away. My classmates and I spent a lot of time working on the speech. The wind blowing on our face made us feel like we were back in high school, having so much fun together. We talked a lot about our past. We remembered school days, our dreams, and being young. It felt like those days were just yesterday. We also tried Hainan's special food. It was really tasty and we had a great time eating it. But this trip was more than just about seeing Hainan's beautiful places. It was also a chance to reconnect with my high school friends. We encouraged each other and made a promise to work hard for a better future. It feels so good to be with them again. Now I'm back home, but I'll always remember the trip and the great time I had with my old friends. Thank you for listening.
