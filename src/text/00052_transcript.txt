It was on an autumn afternoon, I returned to my childhood town to see my grandmother, whom I hadn't visited in years. The town was likely the same, yet it felt both familiar and alike. The streets, the corner cafe, and the row of houses along the main road were all still there, but quieter and slower than my memories. Following the path of old, I slowly reached my grandmother's house. I paused before knocking, and with the door opened, there was my grandmother, who hugged tightly, fine hand-etched wrinkles in her face, and sprinkled grey through her hair. But her words and the love remained unchanged. Inside, the living room smelled of her cooking, a door with family photos, and my childhood toys. Everything seemed untouched by time, though the room seemed smaller. We ate food together and chatted about recent life updates. But as time passed, our conversation turned a little heavier. My grandmother started talking about the friends she had lost, and the good times from the past. I could feel a deep sadness because I realized how much time had taken away from us. Even though we tried to stay positive, there was a deniable sense of loss hanging in the air. When it was time for me to leave, I had a mix of emotions for the past and uncertainty about the future. I held my grandmother's hand tightly and promised her I would come back to visit more often. That day, I learned that even though time takes so much from us, love and memories are forever.
