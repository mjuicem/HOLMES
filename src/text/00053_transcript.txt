A week ago, I went on a hiking trip to the mountain with my friends. We just decided that last night, we packed our bags with all the essentials, like clothes and shoes and something we need to eat and drink. The hike was so challenging but rewarding. We paid a lot of effort to go to the peak, however, we enjoyed the breathtaking views and the valley below. At the top, we also watched the sunset, feeling a sense of accomplishment. We explored the surrounding moors and enjoyed meals with my friends.
