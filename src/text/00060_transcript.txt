In 2022, I visited my great-grandfather for the first time. He lived in a small, quiet village surrounded by green hills and fields. Despite being over 90 years old, he was still remarkably sharp and full of energy. I had heard many stories about him from my family, but meeting him in person felt like a connection to a new chapter of my heritage. As we sat in his living room, drinking tea he had prepared, I asked him about my grandfather's childhood. His face lit up with a warm smile as he began to recall the past. Your grandfather was a naughty boy, he said, drinking the tea, but he had a heart of gold. I remember one time, when he was about seven years old, he tried to help me plant rice in the field. Instead of planting the seedlings in the right place, he scattered them all over the place. When I asked him what he was doing, he told me he wanted the rice plants to be free to grow wherever they liked. We both laughed at the photo of my young grandfather running around the field, completely unaware of the trials he was causing. My great-grandfather then told me about a time when my grandfather saved a small dog. He found it shivering in the rain one day and brought it home, hiding it in his room because he thought I wouldn't let him keep it. When I discovered it, he begged me to let the dog stay, promising he would take care of it. I couldn't say no to his determination. Hearing these stories, I felt as though I was meeting a different version of my grandfather. One boy who was playful, kind, and full of dreams. My great-grandfather's eyes sparked as he spoke, his voice carrying the weight of love and pride. That day, I learned so much more than just a few stories. I gained a deeper understanding of my family's values and history. It was a video that left a lasting impression on my heart, and I promised myself to cherish the story and wisdom passed down through generations.
