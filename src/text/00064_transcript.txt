In the summer of 2019, I had the preparation to visit San Francisco, a city known for its culture and stunning national beauty. It was my first time in California, and I was eager to explore everything the city had to offer. I arrived in San Francisco on a sunny morning, and the first thing that struck me was an Oklahoma Gate bird towing over the bed with its orange color. I decided to start my trip by taking a walk across the bridge. The wind has a blast, but the view was breathtaking. As I walked, I could see the view crashing against the plane of the bridge, and the city skyline stretching out behind me. After crossing the bridge, I made my way to Free Fisherman's Wharf, one of the most popular tourist spots in the city. The air was blasting with activity, filled with street performers, visitors selling fresh seafood, and tourists from all over the world. I stopped at a small Italian restaurant called For Lunch. The meal was full of traditional Italian dishes, and I decided to try the homemade pizza with a side of garlic bread. The food was delicious, and the warm, inviting atmosphere of the restaurant made me feel right at home. The journey to San Francisco not only allowed me to experience the city's rich history and diverse culture, but also gave me a deeper appreciation for the beauty and warmth of the people I met along the way. Despite the small duration of my visit, it left an inside-blank mark on my heart, and I look forward to the day when I can return and explore more of the city.
