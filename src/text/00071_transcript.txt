In 2017, I visited Paris. It was a city I always wanted to see. I arrived early in the morning at the airport and went straight to my hotel near the Eiffel Tower. I was so excited that I decided to start exploring right away. The first place I went to was the Eiffel Tower. It was still morning, so there were not too many people. I took my time to look at the tower from the ground before taking the elevator up. When I reached the top, the view was amazing. I could see the whole city with the Seine River and all the beautiful streets. I stayed there for a long time just looking at everything and feeling so happy to be in Paris. After visiting the Eiffel Tower, I walked to the Louvre Museum. The museum is huge and I knew I would not be able to see everything in one day, so I chose a few famous pieces to see. The Mona Lisa was much smaller than I expected, but I was still so special to see it in real life. I also loved the Winter Victory and other things. Walking through the museum felt like I was traveling back in time, surrounded by so many beautiful and old things.
