Last summer, I visited my cousin who lives near the beach. It was one of the best vacations I have ever had. My cousin's house is in a small town by the sea, very quiet and peaceful. When I arrived, the first thing I noticed was the fresh sea air and the sounds of the waves. My cousin was waiting for me and we spent the afternoon catching up. The house was cozy with lots of plants and big windows where you could see the ocean. Every morning, we woke up early and walked along the beach. At that time, the beach was almost empty and it felt like it was just for us. The sand was cool under our feet and the waves touched our toes as we walked. Sometimes, we would pick up seashells and I loved seeing different colors and shapes. It was such a simple thing to do but it made me feel really happy and relaxed. One day, we returned to the small boat and went out to sea. My cousin knew how to sail and I just enjoyed sitting here, watching the water and feeling the wind. Sadly, to saw dolphins, there were a few of them swimming not far from our boat. We jumped out of the water and I had never seen dolphins in real life before and it was amazing to see them up close. It felt like something you only see on TV but it was happening right in front of us.
