In May of this year, I went to a concert of my favorite idol. It was the first time I traveled alone to a foreign country just for a long-awaited appointment. The decision was made in a hurry. I made up my mind only a month or so before the concert, and I had to prepare all the things for going abroad by myself. It was a stressful and anxiety-ridden process, but the happiness I had been waiting for sustained me through it all. At the concert, I met my idol, who I've loved for a long time, shining brightly on the stage, and fans who love them as much as I do, waving their support sticks and singing along with them. At this concert, I heard one of my favorite songs, which inspired me when I was lost. For the smile that browned with tears, the moment it surfaced again, let's go now. When I was at the concert, the vivid vitality of my favorite idols standing on the stage was contagious to me. I came running across the obstacles, and the moment I saw them, all the hard work during the preparation dissipated, leaving only happiness. I don't regret this trip abroad alone, because the brave enjoy the world first.
