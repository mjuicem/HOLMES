I traveled to Europe with my family this summer, leaving behind many heart-warming stories in the process. One night in Munich, my family and I had drinks at a royal called Bierhaus. Because of the brewery reputation, guests from all over the world enjoyed drinking at the tables. It was the first time I drank a litre of beer in one night. And because I was spending time with my family, I just felt warm and happy. We enjoyed the local specialties of Munich, such as pork knuckles and white sausages. There were not only guests but also two local musicians, and the atmosphere was very happy. I was chatting with my family about family matters, but suddenly a familiar music came to my ears, and that is the classic Chinese song, The Moon Represents My Heart. I was so excited to hear this so-called hometown sound in a foreign country. After my family and I quietly enjoyed the song, we know that it was ordered by some colleagues who were having a party at another table. We raised our glasses in the air and offered each other good wishes. It was a warm and humbling moment that I will never forget.
