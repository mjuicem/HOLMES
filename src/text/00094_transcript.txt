You know, one day, me and my girlfriend went to British together, and we eat French fries there, and we feel very sad because the French fries taste not very good. And we eat some brunch there, and the brunch is much better than Chinese breakfast. And we also eat Hyderabad in London, and you know, Hyderabad there has no server in Hyderabad, and we feel very sad about that. So we go to another hotpot store or restaurant to have the Sichuan hotpot, and the hotpot there is very spicy, and it's the most tasty one that I have eaten. So, you know, the hotpot in London is very excellent, and I have never tasted such a good hotpot like this before. So we feel very happy on the first day we land in London, so, you know, I'm very happy. Next step, we go to Oxford, and we also go to Cambridge to take the boat to view the campus of Cambridge and Oxford, so I must say it's very beautiful. And we don't feel very happy on that day because we can't get the permission into these two top colleges.
