One day, my friends and I decided to go hiking on last night trip. We left earlier and the weather was sunny. The wave of mountains were beautiful. Halfway up, we suddenly hear a faint cry. So at first we thought it was just a wind, but it got louder and sound like someone needed help. So we followed the sound and found a small goat trapped in some rocks. It seems like it just lost its way and couldn't escape. So we quickly decided to help it and I used a rope from my backpack to pull the ghost out. It looked at us and then ran back to the region. I realized that we didn't just save an animal, but we showed teamwork and courage in a tough situation. So we continued to the top and the wave there was even better. So we feel very good that day. So I learned that even a small act of help can help a big difference and I became more respectful of nature and life and it's a really wonderful day so we can do something that's meaningful.
